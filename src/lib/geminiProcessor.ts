Your task is to **deeply analyze and summarize** the following content into **high-quality, concise study notes** designed for fast and effective exam revision.

### üéØ Objectives:
- Extract the **most important, high-yield ideas** from the content
- Write only what a student **must know to succeed** in an exam or professional setting
- Structure the notes around **core concepts**, **key facts**, **logical steps**, or **principles**
- Adapt your tone and style to match the domain:
    - Medicine: symptoms, diagnostics, treatment, clinical red flags
    - Law: definitions, case principles, rulings, doctrine breakdowns
    - Business: models, formulas, strategies, pros/cons
    - Engineering: formulas, methods, core concepts, pitfalls
    - Humanities: themes, definitions, event chains, arguments, philosophies

### üîç How to Think:
- You are preparing a **review sheet** for a student one day before their exam
- Avoid long paragraphs ‚Äî make every sentence **standalone and information-dense**
- Include:
    - Definitions and classifications
    - Short fact-based comparisons (e.g., X vs Y)
    - Core models, frameworks, and stepwise logic
    - Examples only if essential to understanding or memory
- Include **memory aids** or mnemonics where they exist, or invent helpful ones when logical

### üß† Source Handling:
- Synthesize **all provided content** ‚Äî PDF, transcript, tables, OCR text, etc.
- Ignore messy structure or redundancy in the source ‚Äî your output should feel clean, refined, and teaching-ready
- Omit anything that is repetitive, outdated, or purely stylistic in the source

### üìã Format Instructions:
- Use clear section headings
- Bullet points for facts
- Bold important terms
- Add a final **Key Takeaways** section

### üìå Final Output Goal:

A **tight, exam-focused summary** that captures all essential information, without overexplaining ‚Äî designed for a student to absorb quickly and retain efficiently.`;
    } else if (request.style === 'detailed') {
      basePrompt = `You are a highly experienced university-level educator in the subject of ${request.primary}.

Your task is to create a set of **comprehensive, exam-focused study notes** based on the provided content. These notes are meant to help students develop **a deep understanding** of the subject while preparing effectively for exams.

### üéØ **Your Goals:**

- Summarize the material into **clear, logically organized, and in-depth** study notes
- Explain important ideas with **just enough context** to make them understandable and memorable
- Maintain a tone suitable for students revising seriously or learning for the first time
- Include examples, critical points, and **domain-specific logic** (see guide below)
- Where appropriate, **reference the original source** to help students trace back content:
    - If using a quote or idea from a **PDF**, mention the **page number** (e.g. "(p.12)")
    - If referencing spoken content from a **transcript or audio/video**, include the **approximate minute or timestamp** (e.g. "(at ~15:40)")
    - If a **figure, image, or table** is mentioned or relevant, describe it briefly and **point back to its original label or file source**

### üìö How to Approach the Content:
- Think of this as **teaching through notes** ‚Äî progressively build the student's understanding
- Provide:
    - **Key definitions**
    - **Stepwise frameworks**
    - **Mechanisms**
    - **Classifications**
    - **Common misconceptions**
- Include short summaries at the end of longer sections
- Avoid raw data dumps ‚Äî **explain ideas, connect them, and simplify when needed**
